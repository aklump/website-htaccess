# Use the 'redirects' key to set up .htaccess redirects.  The most common use
# case would be to map legacy URLs to new ones.  Redirects defined at the top
# level are shared across all .htaccess files.  See also file-level.  Regex is
# supported, see example below.  Other status codes can be returned by giving
# the numeric status code as the value of status. If the status is between 300
# and 399, the URL argument must be present. If the status is not between 400
# and 499, the URL argument must be omitted. The status must be a valid HTTP
# status code, known to the Apache HTTP Server (see the function
# send_error_response in http_protocol.c). To learn more see:
